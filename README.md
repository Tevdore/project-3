project is the main file, others are included in it. 
  This is a calculator that works just by using double and long long int ( int64 ) for integers and double for fractional numbers. ( I have already written sum and substraction algorithms, I will write other operations also and then I will ad them in main file.
 When whole equation is written, by pressing on '=' button, it turns from infix to postfix by written function then by pressing '=' again it is calculated.
